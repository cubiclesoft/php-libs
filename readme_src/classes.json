	"CSPRNG": "Cross-platform Cryptographically Secure Random Number Generator (CSPRNG).  Unlike nearly all of the classes out there that claim to implement a CSPRNG, this one actually does things correctly because I scoured the actual PHP C source code and spent the necessary time figuring out which calls called the system-level CSPRNG for each major platform.  This class also doesn't wimp out and fallback to some hocus-pocus, non-random, weak sauce solution - it throws an Exception which you intentionally and correctly do not ever catch.

As a direct result, it is blistering fast.  Many, many times faster and smaller than everything else I've used.  [Documentation](https://github.com/cubiclesoft/ultimate-web-scraper/blob/master/docs/tag_filter.md)",

Has HTML form extraction and command-line shell interface capabilities.  I occasionally dream of adding a Javascript parsing engine to it.  Superior in every way to Guzzle when it comes to web scraping (Guzzle is an API consumer, not a web scraper - different domains).

Isn't going to win any performance awards.  Is probably susceptible to DoS attacks due to multiple bugs in PHP.  Used by Cloud Storage Server and PHP App Server.  [Documentation](https://github.com/cubiclesoft/ultimate-web-scraper/blob/master/docs/web_server.md)",
	"WebSocket": "Implements a WebSocket client.  Probably not as robust as it could be on the async front but, unlike most WebSocket classes, this one allows the application to ignore those pesky control packets.  [Docuemtation](https://github.com/cubiclesoft/ultimate-web-scraper/blob/master/docs/websocket.md)",
	"WebSocketServer": "Move over Node.js and whatever else is out there.  A new WebSocket server is in town.  With limits on packet size because, well, WebSocket vulnerabilities.  Actually, you probably shouldn't use this in production environments either.  WebSocket is kind of a broken protocol.  The server exists to test the client because there aren't that many open servers out there.
